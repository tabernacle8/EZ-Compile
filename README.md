######**How To Install:**######

###**Local Version (Desktop, one computer):**###

*Before you start:* Make sure you have node.js installed and applied to PATH

*1)* Download this repository as a ZIP

*2)* Extract the zip to your desktop

*3)* Type your code into the file called "your_code.txt"

*4)* Run "java_convert.js" in your favorite IDE

*5)* Repeat step 4 to re-compile changes to "your_code.txt" (Make sure you save the file!)




###**Portable Version (Flash Drive):**###

*1)* Download this repository as a ZIP

*2)* Extract the zip into your flash drive

*3)* Navigate to the files called: "your_code.txt" and "java_convert.js". Move them directly onto the flash drive folder.

      Confused? When you first open up your flash drive, you see it's contents. Move the files specified above into that "area" that you first see when you open your flash drive.

*4)* Create / edit your code in "your_code.txt"

*5)* Run node.exe

*6)* In the window, type ".load E:\EZ-Compile-master\EZ-Compile-master\java_convert.js" (No quotation marks)

    *NOTE*: Your drive may start with something other than E. Use a different letter if needed.

    NOTE: You may want to change the folder names to something shorter.
    Example: Naming both "EZ-Compile-master" folders to "hi" means you would type: 
        ".load E:\hi\hi\java_convert.js"

*7)* Press enter, the psuedocode in "your_code.txt" will be converted and shown.
   
    NOTE: Make sure you saved your changes in "your_code.txt" before pressing enter

*7)* Repeat 5-6 when you would like to re-compile changes to "your_code.txt".
